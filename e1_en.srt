1
00:00:01,244 --> 00:00:04,844
1995 has been a big year
for the Huang family.

2
00:00:04,865 --> 00:00:09,496
We moved from D.C. to Orlando because my
Dad wanted to open his own restaurant.

3
00:00:09,516 --> 00:00:10,587
Eat up my babies.

4
00:00:11,743 --> 00:00:13,708
But my brother Eddie wasn't happy.

5
00:00:14,558 --> 00:00:15,736
'Lot of white folks here.'

6
00:00:15,756 --> 00:00:18,431
My brother Emery
made friends easily, though.

7
00:00:18,452 --> 00:00:19,751
'I love love.'

8
00:00:19,771 --> 00:00:22,301
And guess who became a real-estate agent.

9
00:00:22,321 --> 00:00:24,266
'Your mommy, that's who.

10
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:29,062
Anyway, have a good summer, Curtis.

11
00:00:29,082 --> 00:00:32,377
Your friend, Evan Huang."

12
00:00:43,045 --> 00:00:45,615
And who do I make this out to?

13
00:00:47,976 --> 00:00:49,277
I can't believe you're graduating.

14
00:00:49,311 --> 00:00:50,445
So stoked...

15
00:00:50,479 --> 00:00:52,512
for high school,
to spend the summer with my mom.

16
00:00:52,548 --> 00:00:54,481
She deejays at the Radisson.

17
00:00:54,517 --> 00:00:56,084
Oh. Good for her.

18
00:00:56,118 --> 00:00:58,914
Good luck surviving the
7th grade next year.

19
00:00:59,255 --> 00:01:01,789
See you around the neighborhood.

20
00:01:04,359 --> 00:01:06,493
Oh! What if you got a tattoo?

21
00:01:06,528 --> 00:01:07,753
No good...

22
00:01:07,772 --> 00:01:09,730
I might want to be Jewish someday.

23
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:12,155
- What are you guys talking about?
- Barefoot Dave: Summer vacation.

24
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:14,355
We have to come back next
year wearing fresh gear

25
00:01:14,376 --> 00:01:15,713
or with an awesome story.

26
00:01:15,733 --> 00:01:18,420
Or we'll be stuck eating lunch
with the janitor all year.

27
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:20,606
Did you know he's writing
a musical about New Jersey?

28
00:01:20,643 --> 00:01:21,841
'Cause you will.

29
00:01:21,876 --> 00:01:23,810
Better have proof to back up your story,

30
00:01:23,846 --> 00:01:25,646
or you'll wind up like
"fake" Kate Anderson.

31
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:29,316
And we walked into dollywood,
and I saw Dolly's house.

32
00:01:29,350 --> 00:01:31,218
Boy: Liar!
Where are your souvenirs?

33
00:01:31,253 --> 00:01:33,754
She eventually went to
Dollywood over Christmas break,

34
00:01:33,789 --> 00:01:35,087
but it was too late.

35
00:01:35,123 --> 00:01:37,090
Yo, I know this already. I'm set.

36
00:01:37,126 --> 00:01:39,061
Is your family going on vacation?

37
00:01:45,677 --> 00:01:47,385
Ohh, that's funny.

38
00:01:47,406 --> 00:01:49,358
I used the money I made working weekends

39
00:01:49,393 --> 00:01:52,090
at my dad's restaurant
to buy something awesome.

40
00:01:52,475 --> 00:01:55,329
Let's just say I'm pumped for the fall.

41
00:01:55,365 --> 00:01:57,432
Vew '95 reebok pumps.

42
00:01:57,468 --> 00:01:58,700
Check it.

43
00:02:02,206 --> 00:02:03,704
- Magic.
- Science.

44
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:05,963
I'mma show up on the first day of 7th grade

45
00:02:05,983 --> 00:02:08,409
fresh as hell.

46
00:02:08,444 --> 00:02:10,378
So, what are you gonna do all summer?

47
00:02:10,849 --> 00:02:12,347
You are looking at it.

48
00:02:30,020 --> 00:02:32,736
We interrupt this music
video with breaking news.

49
00:02:32,757 --> 00:02:35,622
John stockton has been
seen wearing reebok pumps.

50
00:02:35,641 --> 00:02:40,941
I repeat, John Stockton has
been seen wearing reebok pumps.

51
00:02:40,961 --> 00:02:42,620
Come on, son!

52
00:02:42,639 --> 00:02:44,945
Better give those to your
dad or your white neighbor,

53
00:02:44,966 --> 00:02:46,620
'cause they over.

54
00:02:47,949 --> 00:02:50,170
Happy labor day, Hunter.

55
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:12,858
You don't need so many suits.

56
00:03:12,877 --> 00:03:14,375
The convention is only two days.

57
00:03:14,395 --> 00:03:16,270
All the franchise power
players are gonna be there.

58
00:03:16,289 --> 00:03:17,980
I need to make a good impression.

59
00:03:18,001 --> 00:03:19,336
"Which one's Louis Huang?

60
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:22,870
Oh, he's the steakhouse
owner in the sharkskin suit."

61
00:03:22,905 --> 00:03:25,072
Or "he's the Chinese guy."

62
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:27,842
"In the sharkskin suit."

63
00:03:30,455 --> 00:03:31,811
Mommy, guess what.

64
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:33,612
My last baby tooth is loose.

65
00:03:33,633 --> 00:03:35,552
Oh, looks like it's time for another visit

66
00:03:35,573 --> 00:03:37,443
from the tooth fairy.

67
00:03:39,842 --> 00:03:43,659
"Evan, clean your room. The tooth fairy."

68
00:03:44,074 --> 00:03:47,260
I look forward to the fairy's
constructive criticism.

69
00:03:47,296 --> 00:03:49,483
Mom,
when can we go back-to-school shopping?

70
00:03:49,502 --> 00:03:51,087
Right now!

71
00:03:51,436 --> 00:03:53,201
Emery, here's Eddie's old clothes.

72
00:03:53,222 --> 00:03:55,819
Evan, here's Emery's.

73
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:57,175
I've got some good stuff in there.

74
00:03:57,194 --> 00:03:58,991
You're gonna love it.

75
00:04:01,265 --> 00:04:02,676
What are these?

76
00:04:02,711 --> 00:04:06,112
No more velcro.
You're old enough for laces now.

77
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:10,116
No more velcro, your last baby tooth...

78
00:04:10,135 --> 00:04:12,677
congratulations.
You're in the big-kid club.

79
00:04:12,698 --> 00:04:15,489
But I'm the baby. "Baby Evan"?

80
00:04:15,525 --> 00:04:17,891
It's my brand.

81
00:04:18,411 --> 00:04:20,699
Mom, I'm begging you...
I need new school gear.

82
00:04:20,718 --> 00:04:22,750
It starts in a week, and I have nothing!

83
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:25,218
I already bought you
new t-shirts for school,

84
00:04:25,237 --> 00:04:27,901
the kind you like...
with black men on them.

85
00:04:34,608 --> 00:04:36,841
These guys aren't rappers!

86
00:04:36,860 --> 00:04:39,327
They were the gangsters of the sales bin.

87
00:04:41,117 --> 00:04:43,759
Louis: Jessica,
I can't find my suspenders.

88
00:04:43,779 --> 00:04:45,353
In the closet!

89
00:04:46,415 --> 00:04:47,524
Ready for book club?

90
00:04:47,545 --> 00:04:49,925
White wine and "misery"!

91
00:04:49,944 --> 00:04:52,593
It's Chablis. don't be pissed.

92
00:04:54,262 --> 00:04:55,048
- Thank you.
- Okay.

93
00:04:55,067 --> 00:04:57,392
I haven't even started it.

94
00:04:57,413 --> 00:04:58,822
With work and the house

95
00:04:58,843 --> 00:05:01,668
and then the kids being home all summer,
I just...

96
00:05:01,704 --> 00:05:03,324
You know,
you should really think about getting away.

97
00:05:03,345 --> 00:05:05,637
I can't just leave them, honey.

98
00:05:05,658 --> 00:05:07,701
Although, I have thought about it...

99
00:05:07,721 --> 00:05:10,177
just packing a bag and
just getting out of here.

100
00:05:10,213 --> 00:05:12,579
There's this town in south Texas.

101
00:05:12,615 --> 00:05:15,115
I would paint portraits, get a St. Bernard,

102
00:05:15,151 --> 00:05:16,416
rebuild a muscle car.

103
00:05:16,452 --> 00:05:19,487
N-no. I didn't mean you
should abandon your family.

104
00:05:19,523 --> 00:05:21,723
I meant you should just
consider taking them

105
00:05:21,757 --> 00:05:23,456
on a little vacation.

106
00:05:31,894 --> 00:05:33,233
"Vacation."

107
00:05:36,084 --> 00:05:37,365
You're funny.

108
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:40,108
Louis and I don't believe in vacations.

109
00:05:40,142 --> 00:05:42,009
Hey, boss, do we get vacation days?

110
00:05:42,045 --> 00:05:44,769
Your job is a vacation... from poverty.

111
00:05:46,596 --> 00:05:48,449
Louis: I still can't find my suspenders!

112
00:05:48,485 --> 00:05:49,716
Suspender...

113
00:05:49,752 --> 00:05:51,519
working-man accessory.

114
00:05:51,555 --> 00:05:53,922
Holds up the business.

115
00:05:53,956 --> 00:05:56,591
Louis, your suspenders are right here,

116
00:05:56,625 --> 00:05:58,392
next to your...

117
00:06:05,826 --> 00:06:09,137
So, big business trip, huh?

118
00:06:09,172 --> 00:06:10,939
National franchise convention...

119
00:06:10,973 --> 00:06:12,372
biggest in central Florida.

120
00:06:12,408 --> 00:06:13,774
They say that's where the burger man

121
00:06:13,810 --> 00:06:14,942
became the Burger King.

122
00:06:14,978 --> 00:06:17,177
Okay, so, if this is a business trip,

123
00:06:17,213 --> 00:06:19,505
why did you pack your swimsuit?

124
00:06:19,954 --> 00:06:23,778
There's a pool at the hotel,
and a lot of meetings happen there.

125
00:06:25,096 --> 00:06:26,084
To put under my back.

126
00:06:26,103 --> 00:06:28,565
I'll be on my feet all
day long at seminars.

127
00:06:29,175 --> 00:06:31,826
And it's being held at Gator World?

128
00:06:31,862 --> 00:06:35,987
Gator World, the home of the scariest ride
in Florida, "the death roll"?!

129
00:06:36,384 --> 00:06:38,615
♪ Jumpin', bumpin', thrivin' gators ♪

130
00:06:38,636 --> 00:06:40,649
♪ Rides and shows and alligators ♪

131
00:06:40,670 --> 00:06:42,502
♪ Grab the family, come on down ♪

132
00:06:42,538 --> 00:06:44,795
♪ You better swim, or you might drown ♪

133
00:06:44,814 --> 00:06:47,173
This is gonna save my
entire 7th grade year!

134
00:06:47,209 --> 00:06:50,343
Can we please, please,
please go on vacation to Gator World?

135
00:06:50,379 --> 00:06:52,812
I thought we didn't believe in vacations,
Louis?

136
00:06:52,848 --> 00:06:56,298
This isn't a vacation.
It's a business trip.

137
00:06:56,317 --> 00:06:58,918
The conference is at the
hotel next to Gator World.

138
00:06:58,954 --> 00:07:00,913
It has nothing to do with the park itself.

139
00:07:00,932 --> 00:07:02,555
Okay, fine.

140
00:07:02,591 --> 00:07:04,423
If this is a business trip,

141
00:07:04,694 --> 00:07:07,026
then you won't mind if we come with you.

142
00:07:07,062 --> 00:07:08,362
Yeah, if you want.

143
00:07:08,396 --> 00:07:10,898
But I'll be in back-to-back
seminars all day.

144
00:07:10,932 --> 00:07:13,533
Oh, we can entertain ourselves.

145
00:07:13,896 --> 00:07:16,202
Everybody, pack your bags.

146
00:07:16,237 --> 00:07:19,706
We're going on a family business trip.

147
00:07:19,742 --> 00:07:21,141
Yeah!

148
00:07:21,175 --> 00:07:22,742
Yeah.

149
00:07:28,552 --> 00:07:30,574
"The death roll"?
Sounds like a violent ride.

150
00:07:30,595 --> 00:07:31,892
That's the point, son.

151
00:07:31,927 --> 00:07:32,862
If you live,

152
00:07:32,882 --> 00:07:34,627
you get an "I survived
'the death roll'" t-shirt.

153
00:07:34,663 --> 00:07:37,129
That's my key to flossin'
through 7th grade.

154
00:07:37,165 --> 00:07:40,076
Oh, how sweet. Some of my friends
have come to say bye to me.

155
00:07:41,867 --> 00:07:43,670
I'll write you every day.

156
00:08:02,589 --> 00:08:04,274
These guys aren't with the convention.

157
00:08:04,293 --> 00:08:05,891
Must be college kids.

158
00:08:05,911 --> 00:08:08,874
Man: Franchisees in the house!

159
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:14,165
Welcome to Gator World hotel and resort.

160
00:08:14,201 --> 00:08:16,134
I'm gator Carol. How can I help you today?

161
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,105
Hi. Reservation for Louis Huang.

162
00:08:19,139 --> 00:08:20,906
And how many people will
be staying in the room?

163
00:08:20,942 --> 00:08:22,507
How many people are
allowed to stay in the room

164
00:08:22,543 --> 00:08:23,901
before we incur an additional charge?

165
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:25,220
Two adults and two children.

166
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:27,875
That's how many will
be staying in the room.

167
00:08:29,937 --> 00:08:33,051
These two are just visitors...
family in the area.

168
00:08:33,071 --> 00:08:34,519
We're just catching up.

169
00:08:36,484 --> 00:08:38,283
Well,
if you're staying with the conference,

170
00:08:38,302 --> 00:08:40,057
then you can upgrade to the executive suite

171
00:08:40,094 --> 00:08:41,573
for just $20 more.

172
00:08:41,594 --> 00:08:44,311
I bet we can. No, thank you.

173
00:08:44,630 --> 00:08:48,166
See, that's how they get you...
all these additional fees.

174
00:08:48,201 --> 00:08:49,167
Okay, Mr. Huang.

175
00:08:49,202 --> 00:08:51,470
I see you've booked a spa massage

176
00:08:51,504 --> 00:08:54,663
and a dinner reservation
at Csonka's steakhouse?

177
00:08:56,109 --> 00:08:57,942
N-no, that's a mistake.

178
00:08:57,977 --> 00:08:58,909
Okay.

179
00:08:58,945 --> 00:09:00,177
It shows here that you called ahead

180
00:09:00,212 --> 00:09:03,524
to request the end cut of the prime rib?

181
00:09:04,207 --> 00:09:05,616
Mm... Nope, must be someone else.

182
00:09:05,652 --> 00:09:08,152
You faxed over a copy of your credit card

183
00:09:08,187 --> 00:09:11,389
and your driver's license
to hold the reservation.

184
00:09:12,764 --> 00:09:13,490
Data breach.

185
00:09:13,510 --> 00:09:15,994
Clear identity theft.

186
00:09:17,663 --> 00:09:19,856
- Gator Ramone can take your bags.
- Okay.

187
00:09:19,876 --> 00:09:21,769
Oh, I know what you want.

188
00:09:21,788 --> 00:09:24,442
Dollar-dollar bag, right? No, thank you.

189
00:09:24,461 --> 00:09:25,514
We are fine.

190
00:09:25,534 --> 00:09:27,394
Mommy, bao-bao.

191
00:09:27,414 --> 00:09:29,498
Pick you up? You can walk.

192
00:09:32,308 --> 00:09:34,330
Bao-bao.

193
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,780

00:10:04,875 --> 00:10:06,676
Oh, I guess you won't be able to come,
Louis,

204
00:10:06,711 --> 00:10:09,678
because you'll be too busy with business.

205
00:10:10,346 --> 00:10:12,837
That's right. Lots of business.

206
00:10:12,857 --> 00:10:14,683
Do you want me to call the DMV for you,

207
00:10:14,719 --> 00:10:15,851
the credit-card company...

208
00:10:15,886 --> 00:10:18,922
you know, about your identity theft?

209
00:10:19,413 --> 00:10:21,134
Um, yeah. That'll be great.

210
00:10:21,153 --> 00:10:24,697
As long as you don't mind
paying for local calls.

211
00:10:29,072 --> 00:10:30,730
When we get home, then.

212
00:10:30,750 --> 00:10:32,517
Hm, okay.

213
00:10:35,638 --> 00:10:38,173
Hi. I'm gator Octavio. Towel?

214
00:10:38,208 --> 00:10:40,542
Oh,
so you can charge us a towel-rental fee?

215
00:10:40,577 --> 00:10:41,943
No, thank you.

216
00:10:41,979 --> 00:10:44,975
We will be using God's towel... the sun.

217
00:10:46,989 --> 00:10:48,149
Go.

218
00:10:49,754 --> 00:10:53,509
Jessica:
Thousand-year-old black egg with tofu

219
00:10:53,528 --> 00:10:56,859
and grass jelly drink.

220
00:10:56,894 --> 00:10:59,827
Wait 20 minutes to go in the pool.

221
00:11:19,534 --> 00:11:21,270
Mom, when can we go to Gator World?

222
00:11:21,291 --> 00:11:23,217
I said, "later."

223
00:11:23,253 --> 00:11:25,419
Um,
if you're gonna bring outside food here,

224
00:11:25,455 --> 00:11:26,388
I have to charge you.

225
00:11:26,423 --> 00:11:27,889
Now... we can go now.

226
00:11:27,924 --> 00:11:30,261
Chomp, chomp, Gator World.

227
00:11:30,282 --> 00:11:33,894
Hey, help here, please.

228
00:11:37,133 --> 00:11:37,999
Tickets.

229
00:11:38,033 --> 00:11:39,267
We're staying in the hotel.

230
00:11:39,302 --> 00:11:40,301
Hotel is separate.

231
00:11:40,336 --> 00:11:41,735
You got to buy tickets
to get into the park.

232
00:11:41,770 --> 00:11:43,403
Except for our handi-capable friends...

233
00:11:43,438 --> 00:11:45,535
you can come on in for free.

234
00:11:47,923 --> 00:11:49,809
Fine. How much are tickets?

235
00:11:49,846 --> 00:11:52,812
$55 for adults. $45 for kids.

236
00:11:52,849 --> 00:11:56,149
$2 off if you bring your own
cat to feed to the gators.

237
00:11:57,428 --> 00:11:58,870
That's ridiculous.

238
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:02,238
What kind of sucker would
pay those inflated prices?

239
00:12:02,258 --> 00:12:04,490
I'll have an order of the $20 hot wings

240
00:12:04,527 --> 00:12:06,427
and another round of bud lights.

241
00:12:06,461 --> 00:12:07,528
For a few dollars more,

242
00:12:07,562 --> 00:12:09,395
you can upgrade to the collector cups.

243
00:12:10,365 --> 00:12:11,331
Do it.

244
00:12:14,969 --> 00:12:16,836
Kids 5 and under get in free.

245
00:12:16,871 --> 00:12:18,339
They're all 5 and under.

246
00:12:19,967 --> 00:12:22,355
These two are 5 and under.

247
00:12:22,778 --> 00:12:25,178
This one is 5 and under.

248
00:12:25,214 --> 00:12:26,413
Nice try, kid.

249
00:12:26,448 --> 00:12:28,081
But you're wearing sneakers with laces.

250
00:12:28,116 --> 00:12:29,485
Good eye, gator Dan.

251
00:12:29,505 --> 00:12:31,769
Can't get anything past this guy.

252
00:12:32,788 --> 00:12:34,788
But, mom, I need to go on that ride!

253
00:12:34,823 --> 00:12:37,957
Okay, calm down. We'll go on a ride.

254
00:12:37,994 --> 00:12:39,927
Man: Parking lot "c."

255
00:12:39,961 --> 00:12:41,995
Parking lot "crocodile."

256
00:12:42,030 --> 00:12:43,397
Parking lot "c."

257
00:12:43,432 --> 00:12:47,201
This is just as fun as any ride in there.

258
00:12:55,431 --> 00:12:58,599
And then I said, "hey, I don't need
your tax advice, Scottie Pippen."

259
00:12:59,601 --> 00:13:00,567
Jessica: What are you doing here?!

260
00:13:00,602 --> 00:13:01,467
Melanie! Jessica! Louise?!

261
00:13:01,504 --> 00:13:03,003
Rebecca! Janice! Gloria!

262
00:13:06,980 --> 00:13:09,322
I thought you were supposed to
be at the convention center.

263
00:13:09,342 --> 00:13:13,113
Oh, heh, well, uh,
some of the guys here, they...

264
00:13:16,538 --> 00:13:18,033
You are ruining my vacation!

265
00:13:18,052 --> 00:13:20,687
I knew this was a vacation! I knew it!

266
00:13:20,721 --> 00:13:22,688
Well, you got me, Jessica. You win.

267
00:13:22,724 --> 00:13:24,657
For two days a year, I drink bud lights,

268
00:13:24,692 --> 00:13:26,058
play tennis, and eat hot wings.

269
00:13:26,094 --> 00:13:28,226
Moving to the white
suburbs has made you soft.

270
00:13:28,263 --> 00:13:30,096
Woman, I've been soft!

271
00:13:30,130 --> 00:13:33,072
I've been taking business trips for years,

272
00:13:33,092 --> 00:13:36,091
ever since I worked at Steve's
furniture store in D.C...

273
00:13:36,111 --> 00:13:40,212
the mattress expo in Philly,
the credenza-con in Delaware.

274
00:13:40,232 --> 00:13:42,488
The upholstery seminars in Montreal?

275
00:13:42,508 --> 00:13:43,826
Oui.

276
00:13:46,572 --> 00:13:49,044
Boys, your mother and I need to talk.
Go to your rooms.

277
00:13:57,322 --> 00:13:58,855
I didn't tell you because I know...

278
00:13:58,889 --> 00:14:00,322
you think vacations are a waste of time.

279
00:14:00,357 --> 00:14:02,225
Well, I thought you thought that, too!

280
00:14:02,259 --> 00:14:03,559
Well, I need this.

281
00:14:03,595 --> 00:14:05,028
A couple days away recharges me.

282
00:14:05,062 --> 00:14:06,361
It's how I stay so positive.

283
00:14:06,398 --> 00:14:09,578
Oh, so,
you think I don't need a break, too?

284
00:14:09,599 --> 00:14:12,368
The difference is I can't
just check out for a few days

285
00:14:12,403 --> 00:14:14,751
or our whole family would fall apart!

286
00:14:14,772 --> 00:14:15,703
That's not true.

287
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:17,306
You can loosen the reins a little.

288
00:14:17,341 --> 00:14:19,174
- We'll be fine.
- No, that's what you think.

289
00:14:19,210 --> 00:14:20,543
- But if I do... oh.
- What?

290
00:14:20,577 --> 00:14:22,677
We splurge a bit? Spend a little money?

291
00:14:22,712 --> 00:14:23,846
We can afford to.

292
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:26,172
It's a part of being on vacation.

293
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,383
Eddie: Preach it, big man.

294
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:33,070
Look, we work hard all year,

295
00:14:33,090 --> 00:14:34,623
no one harder than you.

296
00:14:34,658 --> 00:14:37,524
Just let go for a day and relax.

297
00:14:38,629 --> 00:14:40,361
I don't know how to relax.

298
00:14:40,397 --> 00:14:42,029
It seems like a waste of time.

299
00:14:42,065 --> 00:14:44,932
I could be marinating meat or driving.

300
00:14:44,951 --> 00:14:47,066
It's easy. I'll show you.

301
00:14:47,464 --> 00:14:48,582
First...

302
00:14:49,840 --> 00:14:50,804
- Oh, aah...
- Louis: Oh, no, no, no, no.

303
00:14:50,841 --> 00:14:51,907
No, no, no, no, no.

304
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:54,581
I know it's free,
but it's freezing in here.

305
00:14:55,913 --> 00:14:59,346
You see, a part of being on
vacation is enjoying yourself.

306
00:15:00,201 --> 00:15:02,121
I'm gonna book you a massage at the spa.

307
00:15:02,142 --> 00:15:03,552
- No, don't!
- Uhp-bup!

308
00:15:03,572 --> 00:15:05,971
Loosen the reins, remember?

309
00:15:06,221 --> 00:15:07,922
Let me handle this.

310
00:15:07,956 --> 00:15:10,490
Now,
you put on the hotel robe and slippers.

311
00:15:25,222 --> 00:15:26,639
Go on.

312
00:15:29,277 --> 00:15:30,756
Boys.

313
00:15:30,777 --> 00:15:32,844
Remember that piece of
paper your mother burned?

314
00:15:32,864 --> 00:15:34,548
That's something called room service.

315
00:15:34,567 --> 00:15:36,731
I'm gonna show you how it works.

316
00:15:36,751 --> 00:15:38,451
Dad, can I go to Gator World?

317
00:15:38,486 --> 00:15:39,619
Of course you can.

318
00:15:39,654 --> 00:15:41,187
I'm in charge of the vacation now.

319
00:15:42,791 --> 00:15:44,490
I want to stay here and learn room service.

320
00:15:44,525 --> 00:15:45,591
That's fine.

321
00:15:45,626 --> 00:15:46,926
I can go by myself.

322
00:15:46,961 --> 00:15:48,293
The park's just across the street.

323
00:15:48,328 --> 00:15:49,995
Well, I drove a bus when I was 11,

324
00:15:50,030 --> 00:15:51,096
so I'm fine with that.

325
00:15:51,131 --> 00:15:52,065
What about you, Evan?

326
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:53,399
What does it matter?

327
00:15:53,434 --> 00:15:56,134
Every step we take in our non-velcro shoes

328
00:15:56,171 --> 00:15:58,572
is another step towards the grave.

329
00:15:58,808 --> 00:16:01,009
Great, so Evan will stay here, too.

330
00:16:05,980 --> 00:16:07,312
Welcome, Jessica.

331
00:16:07,347 --> 00:16:10,115
Now, before we get started,

332
00:16:10,149 --> 00:16:14,152
do you have any injuries that...

333
00:16:15,288 --> 00:16:18,023
Um,
you're supposed to take your clothes off

334
00:16:18,057 --> 00:16:19,490
before you get under the sheet.

335
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:21,726
Why? So you can go through my pockets?

336
00:16:22,705 --> 00:16:25,397
Are you holding your purse?

337
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:27,065
Yes.

338
00:16:27,100 --> 00:16:28,866
I'm just gonna take your purse, okay?

339
00:16:28,902 --> 00:16:30,768
No. And I'm gonna
put it right here on the floor

340
00:16:30,803 --> 00:16:32,470
so you can see it through your face hole.

341
00:16:32,505 --> 00:16:34,138
Just let go, Jessica.

342
00:16:34,173 --> 00:16:36,173
- I can't. I can't let go!
- Just let go.

343
00:16:36,208 --> 00:16:37,475
I ca...

344
00:16:42,211 --> 00:16:43,347
And press.

345
00:16:46,142 --> 00:16:47,552
Is that John tesh?

346
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:51,240
No, it's an underwater recording
of humpback whales singing.

347
00:16:51,501 --> 00:16:53,707
Why would whales be singing?

348
00:16:53,727 --> 00:16:55,058
To communicate their joy.

349
00:16:56,023 --> 00:16:57,894
What do you do for joy, Jessica?

350
00:16:57,929 --> 00:16:59,730
I micromanage my family.

351
00:17:01,133 --> 00:17:04,678
Well, I think the whales are
happy because they're free.

352
00:17:05,738 --> 00:17:07,304
But they're so fat.

353
00:17:07,338 --> 00:17:08,780
Not in the sea.

354
00:17:08,980 --> 00:17:10,941
Underwater, they're weightless...

355
00:17:10,976 --> 00:17:12,989
weightless and free.

356
00:17:15,570 --> 00:17:17,748
They are free.

357
00:17:18,707 --> 00:17:20,217
There we go.

358
00:17:20,857 --> 00:17:22,810
They sing...

359
00:17:22,971 --> 00:17:25,255
Because they are happy and free.

360
00:17:29,661 --> 00:17:30,593
I can't see it.

361
00:17:30,627 --> 00:17:32,561
Oh. Sorry.

362
00:17:32,596 --> 00:17:33,730
That's better. Thank you.

363
00:17:40,363 --> 00:17:43,338
Just need that t-shirt.

364
00:17:50,115 --> 00:17:52,115
John Tesh. Nice.

365
00:17:52,740 --> 00:17:54,883
I take it you enjoyed your massage.

366
00:17:54,919 --> 00:17:57,185
I love being on vacation.

367
00:17:57,221 --> 00:17:59,537
I just wish we didn't have to go home.

368
00:17:59,736 --> 00:18:02,204
Well,
that's how you know you enjoyed yourself.

369
00:18:02,224 --> 00:18:04,558
Now, you head up to the
room and take a long bath.

370
00:18:04,594 --> 00:18:06,301
I'll check out for us.

371
00:18:06,762 --> 00:18:08,363
I'm proud of you.

372
00:18:08,397 --> 00:18:10,384
You learned how to relax.

373
00:18:11,127 --> 00:18:12,066
What the hell is this?!

374
00:18:12,102 --> 00:18:13,701
Is there a problem with your bill?

375
00:18:13,737 --> 00:18:15,236
Of course there's something
wrong with my bill!

376
00:18:15,271 --> 00:18:16,237
Why is it so high?!

377
00:18:16,272 --> 00:18:18,173
Well, it is for six people, sir.

378
00:18:18,208 --> 00:18:21,843
"A-a additional occupancy fee,
resort fee, share fee"?

379
00:18:21,877 --> 00:18:23,778
Oh, those are our hidden fees.

380
00:18:23,814 --> 00:18:24,945
That's how we get ya!

381
00:18:24,980 --> 00:18:28,249
Well, what's a...
$60 for a poolside hairdo?

382
00:18:37,476 --> 00:18:39,769
Hidden fees. That's how they get you.

383
00:18:39,788 --> 00:18:41,978
I didn't do the math! I'm on vacation!

384
00:18:41,998 --> 00:18:44,865
So am I,
so I couldn't protect you from this.

385
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:51,441
You're watching out for
us so I don't have to.

386
00:18:52,983 --> 00:18:55,935
I can be me because I have you.

387
00:19:00,618 --> 00:19:02,260
Give me the bill.

388
00:19:03,384 --> 00:19:04,351
Hello.

389
00:19:04,385 --> 00:19:05,852
So, I was just going through our bill,

390
00:19:05,887 --> 00:19:09,355
and we will not be paying
any of your hidden fees.

391
00:19:09,391 --> 00:19:12,058
Ma'am, you can't choose what part you pay.

392
00:19:12,094 --> 00:19:13,593
Yes, I can.

393
00:19:13,628 --> 00:19:16,134
Tell them what happened, baby.

394
00:19:17,676 --> 00:19:19,413
I was running by the pool

395
00:19:19,433 --> 00:19:21,500
'cause there's no lifeguard on duty.

396
00:19:21,536 --> 00:19:24,503
And no posted signage.
And no posted signage.

397
00:19:24,538 --> 00:19:25,771
And I fell.

398
00:19:25,807 --> 00:19:28,441
And my tooth was knocked out of my head.

399
00:19:28,477 --> 00:19:29,709
Oh, my God.

400
00:19:29,743 --> 00:19:34,969
Your bill didn't include
my child-disfigurement fee.

401
00:19:35,616 --> 00:19:38,251
And that's how I get you.

402
00:19:39,384 --> 00:19:42,422
Oh, we also have AAA,
so it's another 10% off.

403
00:19:43,462 --> 00:19:46,386
I can't believe you got
the hotel charges reduced.

404
00:19:46,406 --> 00:19:48,596
You are on a different level.

405
00:19:49,317 --> 00:19:51,077
Good job, my baby.

406
00:19:51,097 --> 00:19:52,463
Thanks, mommy.

407
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:54,500
The baby is back.

408
00:19:54,535 --> 00:19:56,626
Was that true? Did you really fall
by the pool and lose your tooth?

409
00:19:56,646 --> 00:19:59,304
No. Mom ripped it out with her hands.

410
00:19:59,339 --> 00:20:00,404
Grandma Huang: Hey...

411
00:20:15,256 --> 00:20:18,022
I died, and they brought me back!

412
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:20,791
Aw, hell no!

413
00:20:25,433 --> 00:20:27,461
So, we were cliff-diving off the coast

414
00:20:27,480 --> 00:20:30,494
when I saw them in the water... Sharks.

415
00:20:30,917 --> 00:20:32,397
I grabbed my harpoon...

416
00:20:32,417 --> 00:20:34,163
Dude, that's, like, a baby tooth.

417
00:20:34,424 --> 00:20:35,805
What? No.

418
00:20:35,825 --> 00:20:37,281
It's a tooth from a hammerhead shark.

419
00:20:37,301 --> 00:20:38,874
They're smaller a-and flatter.

420
00:20:38,894 --> 00:20:40,615
More like a "babyhead" shark.

421
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:42,069
Boy: "Babyhead."

422
00:20:42,753 --> 00:20:44,383
Okay, fine.

423
00:20:44,403 --> 00:20:45,527
I didn't do anything this summer

424
00:20:45,547 --> 00:20:47,336
except for sit around and play video games.

425
00:20:47,355 --> 00:20:49,636
- That's cool.
- Nicole?

426
00:20:49,656 --> 00:20:50,880
What are you doing here?

427
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:52,521
I have to repeat the 8th grade.

428
00:20:52,541 --> 00:20:54,797
Partied too much with my mom
and blew off summer school.

429
00:20:54,817 --> 00:20:57,482
Wish I'd done nothing like you.

430
00:20:58,018 --> 00:20:59,351
You know this kid?

431
00:20:59,385 --> 00:21:01,141
Yeah, he's my friend.

432
00:21:03,479 --> 00:21:06,700
You just chilled at home. I like it.

433
00:21:07,421 --> 00:21:09,775
You're like... "Chill" Eddie.

434
00:21:11,627 --> 00:21:13,865
"Somebody stop me!"

435
00:21:14,288 --> 00:21:15,366
From what?

436
00:21:15,402 --> 00:21:17,970
No, what... no. It's...

437
00:21:18,005 --> 00:21:19,471
"Smokin'!"

438
00:21:21,846 --> 00:21:24,375
"The Mask"? Jim Carrey?

439
00:21:27,030 --> 00:21:28,846
"Smokin'!"
